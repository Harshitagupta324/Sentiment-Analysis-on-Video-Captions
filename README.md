# Sentiment Analysis on Video Captions

## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on over 10,000 TED Talk video captions using classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to classify captions into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) and evaluate model performance using statistical validation techniques.

The study combines lexicon-based approaches and machine learning models for multi-class sentiment classification.

## Objectives
- Perform sentiment analysis on large-scale caption data
- Apply lexicon-based sentiment scoring
- Build a multi-class classifier
- Evaluate using cross-validation

## Dataset
- 10,000+ TED Talk video captions
- Text-based dataset
- Multi-class sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- VADER
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- NumPy
